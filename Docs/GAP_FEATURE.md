# PhishQS Session Summary - August 28, 2025

## Session Overview: Gap Data Implementation & Performance Optimization

**Duration:** ~5 hours  
**Status:** Major feature completion with performance optimizations  
**Next Session Priority:** Complete CSV-to-JSON bundling system

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Gap Data Feature - FULLY IMPLEMENTED âœ…

**Problem Solved:** Display top 3 rarest songs (highest gaps) for each tour with real Phish.net data

**Key Implementations:**
- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated Phish.net `/setlists/slug/[song-name].json` endpoint
- **Data Models**: Enhanced SongPerformance, SongGapInfo, EnhancedSetlist with gap information
- **Tour Logic**: Fixed tour-progressive gap tracking to keep highest gaps across entire tour
- **Display Format**: Matches exact requirements with proper venue run logic (N1/N2/N3)

**Critical Bug Fixed:**
Original tour-progressive logic kept most recent show occurrence instead of highest gap occurrence. This caused "Devotion To A Dream" (322 gap) to be replaced by lower-gap songs from later shows. Fixed to properly maintain cumulative top 3 across tour.

### 2. Performance Optimization - 97% IMPROVEMENT âœ…

**Before:** ~60 seconds to load tour statistics (23 sequential API calls for Summer Tour 2025)  
**After:** ~1-2 seconds for cached loads, ~2 seconds for active tour updates

**Optimization Strategies Implemented:**
- **Extended Cache TTLs**: Historical data cached much longer (24 hours vs 1 hour)
- **Tour-Level Caching**: Cache entire `[EnhancedSetlist]` collection per tour
- **Incremental Updates**: Active tours add new shows to cached data instead of recalculating everything
- **Smart Cache Logic**: Differentiate between historical (immutable) and active (changing) data

### 3. Data Accuracy Validation âœ…

**Gap Number Discrepancies Explained:**
- Manual Phish.net checks vs app results showed -1 difference for some songs
- Root cause: Date reference differences (final show date vs performance date)
- This is correct behavior - gap numbers increase as more shows pass
- "Devotion To A Dream" matched exactly (322 gap), confirming API accuracy

**Expected Results Validated:**
1. "On Your Way Down" - 521 gap (from 7/18/25)
2. "Paul and Silas" - 322 gap (from 6/24/25)
3. "Devotion To A Dream" - 322 gap (from 7/11/25)

## Critical Technical Details

### Tour-Progressive Logic Requirements
```
Show 1: Top 3 songs with highest gaps from opening show
Show 2: If any Show 2 songs have higher gaps than current top 3, replace lowest
Show N: Maintain cumulative top 3 rarest songs across all shows 1â†’N
New Tour: Reset - start fresh with new tour's first show
```

### Display Format Requirements
```
Song Name                    Gap#
Date - Venue (current show)  Last played date (gap-creating date)

Example:
On Your Way Down             521
Jul 18, 2025 - United Center Aug 6, 2011
```

### Architecture Rules
- **Above setlist**: Show-specific information (date, venue, songs)
- **Below setlist**: Tour-wide information (statistics, top 3 across entire tour)
- **N1/N2/N3 Logic**: Only show when totalNights > 1, otherwise show nothing
- **Historical vs Live**: Aggressive caching for completed tours, real-time for active tours

## In-Progress Work: CSV-to-JSON Bundling System

### Goal
Pre-compute all historical tour statistics for instantaneous loading (0ms vs current 2 seconds)

### Data Sources Provided
1. **Bustout CSV**: `~/Downloads/Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet3.csv`
   - 532 rows through 7/27/25
   - Song, Artist, Show Gap, Previous Time Played, Bustout Show

2. **Tour Boundaries CSV**: `~/Downloads/Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet4.csv`
   - 118 rows of official tour names and show counts
   - Used for accurate tour correlation

### Implementation Status
- **âœ… TourStatisticsLoader.swift**: Smart loader choosing bundled vs live data
- **âœ… BustoutDataProcessor.swift**: CSV parsing and tour correlation logic
- **âœ… generate_tour_stats.swift**: JSON generation script
- **ðŸš§ INTERRUPTED**: Script was generating JSON files when session ended

### Expected Output
```
/Resources/TourStatistics/
â”œâ”€â”€ SummerTour2025.json    # Top 3: On Your Way Down (522), Paul and Silas (323), Devotion To A Dream (322)
â”œâ”€â”€ SpringTour2025.json
â”œâ”€â”€ SummerTour2024.json
â””â”€â”€ ... (back to 1988)
```

## Next Session Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 1: Complete Bundling System
1. **Resume script execution** - Complete JSON file generation from CSVs
2. **Integrate smart loader** - Update LatestSetlistViewModel to use bundled data
3. **Test performance** - Verify 0ms load times for historical tours

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 2: Validation & Testing  
1. **Verify expected results** - Test Summer Tour 2025 shows correct top 3
2. **Edge case testing** - Large tours, missing data, cache corruption
3. **Performance monitoring** - Add logging for load times and cache hit ratios

### PRIORITY 3: Future Enhancements
1. Color scale for song lengths (green=short, red=long)
2. LivePhish/Phish.net recording links
3. Future tour dates integration
4. Day of week display
5. Remove loading animations (may be unnecessary after optimizations)

## Known Edge Cases & Considerations

### API Behavior
- Some songs show -1 gap discrepancy (timing/caching differences)
- Rate limiting requires 0.1-second delays between requests
- Historical data (pre-1990) may be incomplete

### Tour Boundaries
- Festival dates and single shows need special handling
- Some bustouts may not correlate to official tour names  
- Tour completion detection needed for bundling eligibility

### Performance Scenarios
- Large tours (30+ shows) still require initial cache population
- Network failures during incremental updates
- Cache corruption or expiration during active viewing

### User Experience
- First-time users will still experience ~60-second load for uncached tours
- Subsequent users benefit from cached data immediately
- Active tour viewers see performance improve as tour progresses

---

## Success Metrics Achieved

- **Performance**: 60 seconds â†’ 2 seconds (97% improvement)
- **Accuracy**: Gap calculations match Phish.net (with explainable differences)  
- **Display**: Matches design requirements exactly

- **Architecture**: Clean, reusable, follows Swift best practices
- **Caching**: Multi-level strategy appropriate for data types

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Code Quality

- Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Extensive debugging logs for troubleshooting
- Cache keys and TTLs centralized

### Scalability

- Edge cases identified and documented
- Performance monitoring ready for implementation

## Context for Next Developer Session

The gap data feature represents a significant milestone - it's the first feature that successfully combines real-time API data with aggressive performance optimization. The tour-progressive logic was particularly complex because it needed to maintain cumulative statistics across an entire tour while handling edge cases like songs appearing multiple times.

The performance optimizations go beyond typical caching - they recognize that Phish historical data is immutable once a tour completes, enabling much more aggressive caching strategies. The CSV-to-JSON bundling system takes this further by pre-computing historical statistics entirely.

The next session should focus on completing the bundling system, as this will transform the app's performance profile from "fast for cached data" to "instantaneous for 95% of usage" (since most tour views are historical).

Key testing should focus on the tour-progressive logic with Summer Tour 2025 data, ensuring the top 3 rarest songs display correctly with proper gap numbers and historical dates.
