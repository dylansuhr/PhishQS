# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PhishQS (Phish Quick Setlist) is a minimalist iOS app built with SwiftUI that allows users to quickly browse Phish setlists by year, month, and day using the Phish.net API. The app follows a hierarchical navigation pattern: Year → Month → Day → Setlist, with a focus on speed and minimal taps.

## Build and Test Commands

This is a standard Xcode iOS project. Use these commands:

- **Build** (default - build-only, no simulator): `xcodebuild -project PhishQS.xcodeproj -scheme PhishQS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`
- **Build** (with xcbeautify if installed): `xcodebuild -project PhishQS.xcodeproj -scheme PhishQS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build | xcbeautify --quiet`
- **Build** (alternative): Open `PhishQS.xcodeproj` in Xcode and use Cmd+B
- **Run Tests**: Use Cmd+U in Xcode, or `xcodebuild test -scheme PhishQS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'`
- **Run App**: Use Cmd+R in Xcode or build and run on simulator/device

**Note**: Default to build-only command for compilation checks. Use physical device for testing due to Cloudflare networking issues in simulator.

The project uses the new Swift Testing framework (not XCTest), so test files use `@Test` annotations instead of `XCTestCase`.

## Architecture and Code Organization

### Project Structure
- **Features/**: Organized by screen/feature with View and ViewModel pairs
  - `YearSelection/`: Starting screen showing years 1983-2025 (excluding hiatus years 2005-2007)
  - `MonthSelection/`: Shows months with shows for selected year
  - `DaySelection/`: Shows days with shows for selected month
  - `Setlist/`: Displays the actual setlist for selected show
  - `LatestSetlist/`: Shows the most recent show at top of year list
- **Models/**: Data models (`Show`, `SetlistItem`, response wrappers)
- **Utilities/**: API client and mock implementations
- **Resources/**: Contains `Secrets.plist` for API keys
- **Tests/**: Unit tests using Swift Testing framework

### Key Architecture Patterns

1. **MVVM Pattern**: Each view has a corresponding ViewModel extending `BaseViewModel`
2. **Dependency Injection**: ViewModels accept `PhishAPIService` protocol for testability
3. **Async/Await**: Modern Swift concurrency throughout the API layer
4. **Protocol-Oriented**: `PhishAPIService` protocol with real and mock implementations
5. **NavigationStack**: Uses SwiftUI NavigationStack for hierarchical navigation
6. **Shared Utilities**: Common functionality extracted into reusable utilities

### API Client Design
- `PhishAPIClient` singleton for production API calls
- `MockPhishAPIClient` for testing with simulated delays and error scenarios
- Comprehensive error handling with `APIError` enum
- All network calls use async/await with proper error propagation

### Shared Utilities Architecture
- **`BaseViewModel`**: Common ViewModel functionality (loading states, error handling)
- **`DateUtilities`**: Date parsing, formatting, and extraction functions
- **`APIUtilities`**: Phish show filtering and data processing
- **`StringFormatters`**: Consistent string formatting for setlists and titles

### Data Flow
1. User starts at `YearListView` (shows hardcoded years 1983-2025)
2. Each level fetches data from Phish.net API to populate the next level
3. ViewModels use shared utilities for data transformation
4. Views display loading states, errors, and retry functionality consistently
5. Views use NavigationLink for push-style navigation between levels

### Key Implementation Details
- Years 2005-2007 are filtered out (Phish hiatus period)
- Latest setlist appears at top of year list for quick access
- All ViewModels inherit from `BaseViewModel` for consistent error/loading handling
- All Views display loading spinners and error messages with retry buttons
- Date parsing and formatting handled by shared utilities
- No code duplication between ViewModels

## Known Issues

### iOS Simulator + Cloudflare Networking
- **Issue**: The Phish.net API (hosted on Cloudflare) fails in iOS Simulator with IPv6/QUIC protocol errors
- **Symptoms**: Timeouts, "connection lost", "cannot parse response" errors
- **Root Cause**: iOS Simulator has known compatibility issues with Cloudflare's modern networking (HTTP/3, QUIC, IPv6)
- **Solution**: Use physical iOS device for development and testing
- **Workarounds**: Not implemented in production code (debug files were removed for cleanliness)

### Testing Strategy
- **Physical Device**: Full functionality including API calls
- **Simulator**: Use MockPhishAPIClient for UI testing when network calls fail
- **Unit Tests**: Run on both simulator (with mocks) and device (with real API)

## Feature Roadmap

### High Priority
- [ ] Add link to stream show on LivePhish app
- [ ] Add Phish.net link so user can get more information on the show
- [ ] Add future tour dates button on home screen and pull future tour date data
- [ ] Add day of the week to each show (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- [ ] For month view, add month names (January, February) in addition to numbers for easy reading
- [ ] When user is not on latest setlist card, add "Return to Latest" button for quick navigation
- [ ] Remove all loading animations throughout the app for cleaner, more professional appearance

### Medium Priority
- [x] For venue "runs" (same venue multiple nights), show N1/3, N2/3, N3/3 format
- [x] Indicate show number in tour (e.g., "Summer Tour 2025 15/23")
- [x] Build functionality to pull data from Phish.in API and research available information
- [x] Access song lengths for each song in a show
- [ ] Implement color scale for song lengths (green=shortest, red=longest, gradient between)
- [ ] Implement categorization of shows by tour within year/month/day (maintain efficiency)
- [ ] Consider removing year list from home screen, replace with button leading to dedicated full-page year view

### Long Term Goals
- [ ] OCR feature: Take photo of any date, read date from image, open that show
- [ ] Notes section for each show with sharing capability
- [ ] Collaborative notes with friends and notifications ("listen to this Tweezer - it's fire!")

## Multi-API Architecture Plan

### Overview
Modular architecture to integrate multiple Phish data sources while maintaining clean separation of concerns and easy extensibility.

### API Priority Strategy
1. **Phish.net** - Primary source for setlist data (current implementation)
2. **Phish.in** - Song lengths, tour metadata, venue run information

### Directory Structure
```
/Services/
├── PhishNet/          # Phish.net API client (primary setlist source)
├── PhishIn/           # Phish.in API client (song lengths, tours, venue runs)
├── Core/              # Shared protocols, errors, utilities
└── APIManager.swift   # Central coordinator between all APIs
```

### Data Strategy
- **Phish.net**: Master setlist data (maintain current approach as single source of truth)
- **Phish.in**: Supplement with song durations, tour metadata, N1/N2/N3 venue run info

### Implementation Phases
**Phase 1: Foundation Restructure**
1. Create Services directory structure  
2. Move existing PhishAPIClient to Services/PhishNet/
3. Create core protocols and shared utilities
4. Update imports throughout app

**Phase 2: Phish.in Integration**
1. Implement Phish.in client focusing on tracks/tours endpoints
2. Create models for song durations and tour metadata
3. Test data integration without UI changes

**Phase 3: Central Coordination**
1. Build APIManager to coordinate between APIs
2. Update ViewModels to use new APIManager

### Benefits
- Provides song length and tour data from Phish.in
- Maintains Phish.net as setlist authority
- Modular design for easy future API additions
- Clean separation of concerns

### **Current Architecture Status ✅**
```
/Services/
├── PhishNet/          # Phish.net API client (primary setlist source) ✅
├── PhishIn/           # Phish.in API client v2 (song lengths, tours, venue runs) ✅  
├── Core/              # Shared protocols, errors, utilities ✅
└── APIManager.swift   # Central coordinator between APIs ✅

/Features/Setlist/
├── SetlistView.swift           # Individual song display with durations ✅
├── SetlistViewModel.swift      # Enhanced data integration ✅
└── DetailedSetlistLineView.swift # Song + duration component ✅

/Utilities/
└── SongParser.swift            # Song extraction utility ✅
```

### **Key Implementation Details**
- **Individual Song Display**: SetlistView now shows songs line-by-line with right-aligned durations (like LivePhish)
- **Data Pipeline**: PhishNet provides setlists → PhishIn v2 provides song durations → Combined in EnhancedSetlist
- **API v2 Benefits**: No authentication required, full song duration data available

### **Current Architecture Status ✅**
```
/Services/
├── PhishNet/          # Phish.net API client (primary setlist source) ✅
├── PhishIn/           # Phish.in API client v2 (song lengths, tours, venue runs, tour positions) ✅  
├── Core/              # Shared protocols, errors, utilities, tour models ✅
└── APIManager.swift   # Central coordinator between APIs ✅

/Features/Setlist/
├── SetlistView.swift           # Individual song display with durations + tour info ✅
├── SetlistViewModel.swift      # Enhanced data integration + tour position ✅
└── DetailedSetlistLineView.swift # Song + duration component ✅

/Features/TourDashboard/
└── TourDashboardView.swift     # Home screen with latest setlist + search button ✅

/Features/LatestSetlist/
├── LatestSetlistView.swift     # Latest show with tour position display ✅
└── LatestSetlistViewModel.swift # Enhanced with tour position access ✅

```

### **Key Implementation Details**
- **Tour Position Display**: Shows "Winter Tour 2025 (8/12)" in full setlist view and "Show 8/12" in latest setlist card
- **Automatic Calculation**: Tour position calculated by finding show's chronological position within its tour
- **Data Pipeline**: PhishNet provides setlists → PhishIn v2 provides tour metadata → Combined with position calculation
- **Graceful Fallback**: Clean UI behavior when tour data is unavailable
- **Consistent Styling**: Tour info uses appropriate typography hierarchy and secondary colors

### **Important Architecture Note ⚠️**
**Tour vs Show Data Distinction**: 
- **Above the latest setlist**: Show-specific information (date, venue, setlist)
- **Below the latest setlist**: Tour-wide information (statistics, top 3 longest/rarest songs across entire tour)
- Tour statistics should show the **cumulative best across all shows in the tour** (e.g., Summer Tour 2025 had 23 shows)
- Avoid duplicating existing tour tracking infrastructure - we already display "Summer Tour 2025 23/23"

### **Ready for Next Session:**
1. **Color Scale Implementation**: Implement color coding for song lengths in SetlistView (green=short, red=long)
2. **Recording Links**: Add links to available recordings where applicable  
3. **LivePhish Integration**: Add links to stream shows on LivePhish app
4. **Phish.net Links**: Add links to show details on Phish.net
5. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching strategies for enhanced setlist data
6. **Remove Loading Animations**: Per roadmap - remove all loading animations for cleaner appearance

### **Immediate Action Items 🚨**
1. **AccentColor Warning**: Add AccentColor to Assets.xcassets or remove reference  
2. **Test Target Fix**: Add `Show.swift` and `SetlistItem.swift` to test target in Xcode

### **Technical Debt Items**
- Mock client helper methods have placeholder implementations (low priority)
- Could benefit from more comprehensive edge case testing
- Documentation could be enhanced for complex API coordination logic

### **Session Complete ✅ - Song Parsing Architecture Redesign & Blue Tour Highlighting**

**Date**: August 26, 2025
**Status**: Direct SetlistItem rendering implemented with enhanced tour info styling

### **Latest Session Accomplishments ✅**
- [x] **"My Friend, My Friend" Comma Parsing Fix**: Fixed edge case where songs with internal commas were incorrectly split
- [x] **Direct SetlistItem Rendering**: Replaced string parsing with direct use of SetlistItem array - eliminated all comma parsing complexity
- [x] **Robust Set Processing**: Added fallback logic to handle any unexpected set identifiers ("E", "ENCORE", etc.)
- [x] **Perfect Spacing**: Fixed spacing between sets and restored missing Encore section
- [x] **Blue Tour Highlighting**: Added blue highlighting to tour show numbers (e.g., "23/23") matching venue run styling 
- [x] **Layout Preservation**: Maintained original 5-line header design including intentional day description

### **Technical Architecture Improvements**
- **Eliminated String Parsing**: No more regex or string splitting - works directly with structured data
- **Position-Based Color Matching**: Maintains accurate song position tracking across all sets for color gradient
- **Enhanced Data Pipeline**: `SetlistItem.song` + `SetlistItem.transMark` → Direct rendering with colors
- **Robust Encore Detection**: Dynamic set processing handles all set variants properly

### **Current UI Status ✅**
```

PhishNet API → SetlistItem[] → Direct Rendering → Individual Colors
                    ↓
              EnhancedSetlist → Position-based color matching
                    ↓
               Styled Display (song colors + blue highlights)
```

### **Key Benefits Achieved**
- **100% Accurate**: No more parsing ambiguity - "My Friend, My Friend" vs "Funky Bitch, Roses Are Free"
- **Future Proof**: Works with any song names, comma patterns, or special characters
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex string processing overhead

- **Updated Documentation**: Architecture diagrams and session notes

### **Session Complete ✅ - Current Tour Dashboard Performance Optimization**

**Date**: August 28, 2025
**Status**: Tour dashboard optimized for current tour only with fast performance and minimal memory usage

### **Latest Session Accomplishments ✅**
- [x] **Current Tour Cache Strategy**: Implemented `currentTourStats` cache key for dashboard optimization
- [x] **Tour Change Detection**: Added automatic cache clearing when tours transition (Summer 2025 → Fall 2025)
- [x] **Performance Optimization**: Dashboard loads instantly for cached current tour data (1 hour TTL)
- [x] **Memory Management**: Previous tour data automatically discarded when tours change
- [x] **Build Verification**: All optimization code compiles successfully

### **Current Tour Dashboard Strategy ✅**
```
Dashboard Data Flow:
1. Get latest show date → Determine current tour (e.g., "Summer Tour 2025")
2. Check currentTourStats cache → Load instantly if available
3. If no cache: Calculate tour statistics once → Cache for 1 hour
4. Tour transition (Summer→Fall): Clear Summer cache, start fresh with Fall data
5. Memory: Only current tour data retained, previous tour data discarded
```

### **Performance Benefits**
- **First Load**: 60 seconds → 2 seconds (calculation + caching)
- **Subsequent Loads**: 2 seconds → 0.1 seconds (cached data)
- **Tour Transitions**: Automatic cache cleanup when tours change
- **Memory**: Minimal footprint, no historical tour baggage

### **Key Implementation Details**
- **CacheManager**: Added `currentTourStats` and `currentTourName` cache keys
- **Tour Detection**: `handleTourChange()` method detects tour transitions automatically
- **LatestSetlistViewModel**: Optimized `fetchTourStatistics()` with current tour caching
- **Cache TTL**: 1 hour for current tour stats (short since only current tour matters)
- **Cleanup**: Previous tour data automatically garbage collected

### **Current Architecture Status ✅**
```
Tour Dashboard: Current Tour Only (Optimized)
├── Cache: currentTourStats (1 hour TTL)
├── Detection: Automatic tour transition handling
