# GitHub Actions Automation Implementation

## Task Overview
Implement automated tour data updates using GitHub Actions to eliminate manual intervention when new Phish shows occur.

## Implementation Reasoning
The PhishQS codebase is architecturally perfect for automation due to its single source of truth design. All components read from the same JSON files, and the system already has built-in update detection logic that only commits changes when new shows are detected. This automation will run 3x daily with strategic timing to catch shows after they end and ensure data is fresh before evening shows.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Environment Variable Support âœ… COMPLETED
**File**: `Server/Config/StatisticsConfig.js`
**Change**: Line 96
```javascript
// From:
defaultApiKey: '4771B8589CD3E53848E7', // TODO: Move to environment variables

// To:
defaultApiKey: process.env.PHISH_NET_API_KEY || '4771B8589CD3E53848E7',
```
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- âœ… Scripts can read API key from environment variable
- âœ… Falls back to hardcoded value for compatibility
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow âœ… COMPLETED
**File**: `.github/workflows/update-tour-data.yml`
**Content**: Complete workflow file with:
- Strategic 3x daily schedule (midnight, 4am, 4pm EDT)
- Full automation pipeline (update-tour-dashboard â†’ initialize-tour-shows â†’ generate-stats)
- Smart commit logic (only commits when changes detected)
- Manual trigger capability
- Proper error handling and logging

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Runs on optimal schedule for post-show and pre-show timing
- âœ… Only commits when new show data detected
- âœ… Includes manual trigger for immediate updates
- âœ… Uses proper GitHub Actions security practices

### 3. Documentation Updates âœ… COMPLETED
**File**: `CLAUDE.md`
**Added**: Comprehensive automated deployment section including:
- Setup instructions for GitHub secrets
- Explanation of automation workflow
- Manual trigger instructions
- Expected behavior documentation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… Clear setup instructions for future maintainers
- âœ… Explains automation timing and strategy
- âœ… Documents both automated and manual deployment options

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- âœ… Existing scripts all function correctly (`update-tour-dashboard`, `initialize-tour-shows`, `generate-stats`)
- âœ… Built-in update detection logic works properly
- âœ… Vercel auto-deployment on git push is configured
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: GitHub secret `PHISH_NET_API_KEY` configured

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Benefits Leveraged
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All 4 components read from same JSON files generated by automation
2. **Smart Update Detection**: Built-in `checkIfUpdateNeeded()` function prevents unnecessary commits
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App displays setlists immediately, adds colors when Phish.in data arrives
4. **Component Isolation**: Each component handles missing data professionally

### Schedule Strategy
- **Midnight EDT** (4am UTC): Post-show detection for East Coast shows
- **4am EDT** (8am UTC): Late shows and West Coast coverage
- **4pm EDT** (8pm UTC): Pre-show data refresh and Phish.in retry logic

### Data Flow Analysis - SETLIST-BASED DETECTION IMPLEMENTED
**System Enhancement (2025-09-13)**:
âœ… **CRITICAL FIX**: Implemented setlist-based played detection instead of timezone-prone date comparisons
- **Root Cause**: Scripts used `showdate <= today` causing 9/13 show to be marked "played" at midnight EDT
- **Solution**: Now uses Phish.net setlist API - only shows with actual song data are marked as played
- **Benefits**: Eliminates timezone issues, uses single source of truth (API data)

**Current State (After Fix)**:
1. âœ… **9/12 Louisville Show**: Correctly detected as PLAYED (19 songs in setlist)
2. âœ… **9/13 Birmingham Show**: Correctly shows as NOT PLAYED YET (0 songs until show ends)
3. âœ… **Latest Show**: 2025-09-12 (not incorrectly showing 9/13)
4. âœ… **Tour Dashboard**: 2025 Late Summer Tour - 1/8 shows played
5. âœ… **Statistics**: Generated from 9/12 show only (Dreams - gap 218 as top rare song)
6. âœ… **All Scripts**: Pass full sequence test without errors

**Tonight's Expected Behavior (2025-09-13 Birmingham show)**:
1. Midnight automation checks setlist API for 2025-09-13
2. If show has ended: setlist data exists â†’ process as new played show
3. If show hasn't ended: no setlist data â†’ wait for next run
4. Updates will include both 9/12 + 9/13 show data when available

### Component Impact Verification
**Component A (Tour Setlist Browser)**:
- âœ… Displays new tour name dynamically
- âœ… Shows setlist immediately (colors appear when durations arrive)
- âœ… Tour position badges work (Show 1/8)

**Component B (Tour Statistics)**:
- âœ… Shows "2025 Late Summer Tour" in header
- âœ… Rarest/Most Played cards populate immediately
- âœ… Longest Songs card shows "No duration data available" gracefully

**Component C (Historical Show Search)**:
- âœ… No impact (uses real-time APIs)

**Component D (Tour Calendar)**:
- âœ… Shows only months with tour dates (Sept 2025, Jan 2026)
- âœ… Current day indicator on Sept 12
- âœ… Venue badges for tour dates

### Error Handling
- GitHub Actions workflow includes proper error handling
- Failed API calls don't break the pipeline (Promise.allSettled used)
- Missing Phish.in data handled gracefully (empty arrays)
- Manual trigger available as fallback

## Testing and Validation

### Pre-Implementation Testing âœ… COMPLETED
- Manually ran `npm run update-tour-dashboard` - successfully detected tonight's show
- Confirmed all scripts execute without errors
- Verified data flows correctly through all components
- Tested visual handling of missing duration data

### Post-Implementation Testing âœ… COMPLETED
1. âœ… **Manual Trigger Test**: All scripts run successfully in sequence
2. âœ… **Component Integration**: All 4 components display 2025 Late Summer Tour correctly
3. âœ… **API Endpoints**: Both tour-dashboard and tour-statistics serve correct data
4. âœ… **Setlist Detection**: Properly identifies 9/12 as played, 9/13 as not played yet
5. âœ… **Error Resolution**: Fixed GitHub Actions automation failure caused by timezone issues
6. âœ… **Comprehensive Verification**: System ready for tonight's automated run

## Future Maintenance
- **Zero maintenance required** after GitHub secret setup
- System is **tour-agnostic** - works for any future tour automatically
- **Free tier friendly** - ~450 minutes/month usage (well under 2000 limit)
- **Manual override always available** via workflow_dispatch trigger

## Completion Status
- âœ… **Environment Variable Support**: Implemented
- âœ… **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Created and configured
- âœ… **Documentation**: Updated with setup instructions
- âœ… **GitHub Secret**: Configured and active
- ðŸš€ **FULLY AUTOMATED**: System is live and operational

## Automation Active - FULLY OPERATIONAL
âœ… **GitHub secret `PHISH_NET_API_KEY`**: Configured and tested
âœ… **Automation schedule**: Running 3x daily (midnight, 4am, 4pm EDT)  
âœ… **Manual trigger**: Available via Actions tab
âœ… **Setlist-based detection**: Implemented and verified
âœ… **Error resolution**: Timezone issues fixed
âœ… **Comprehensive testing**: All systems verified operational
âœ… **Ready for production**: Tonight's show will be processed correctly

## Technical Achievements
- **Fixed critical automation failure**: Resolved timezone-based date comparison issues
- **Implemented robust detection**: Uses Phish.net setlist API as single source of truth
- **Verified end-to-end functionality**: All scripts, APIs, and app components working correctly
- **Zero-maintenance system**: Fully automated with proper error handling and fallbacks

This implementation leverages the existing architecture perfectly, uses minimal code changes, and provides maximum automation value with bulletproof reliability.
