      "jamchart_description": "Killer version that swirls out of the standard jam with melodic invention aplomb. The band's driving rhythm never sways, instead allowing for an almost trance-inducing atmosphere to gradually but surely take hold and eventually build to a well-earned climax around the 16:00 mark. Instead of fading out, the band instead finds a wonderful coda in an ambient space-age atmosphere dominated by guitar loops, Mike's drill, and massive synthesizer washes.",
