This show featured the Phish debuts of Cream (Prince and the New Power Generation) and Sincere. The second setbreak featured songs focused on &quot;ice,&quot; &quot;cream,&quot; and &quot;ice cream.&quot; The ice cream man returned during Harry Hood while dancing milk cartons appeared on stage with the cartons eventually being discarded. The dancers ended up exiting through a giant &quot;it&#39;s ice cream&quot; freezer. During 2001, ice cream men brought out giant ice cream props from the freezer, Trey took over on drums, and Fish descended into the freezer. A fake Fish then rose with a giant popsicle (a bomb pop). During Tweezer, dancers from past New Year&#39;s Eve gags exited the freezer and at times performed the Meatstick dance. Trey teased Meatstick in Tweezer. The encore featured the band in ice cream man outfits. Spock&#39;s Brain was performed for the first time since July 14, 2019 (238 shows). A giant milk carton with a &quot;Missing: Spock&#39;s Brain&quot; notice reappeared (from earlier in the evening) above the band for Spock&#39;s Brain and Tweezer Reprise.</p>\r\n",
