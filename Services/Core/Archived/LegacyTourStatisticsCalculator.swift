/// Legacy iOS calculation methods for tour statistics
/// 
/// **ARCHIVED**: These methods are preserved for future reference but not actively used.
/// The app now fetches pre-computed statistics from the server for instant loading.
/// 
/// Original functionality:
/// - Calculated tour statistics locally on iOS device
/// - Processing time: 60+ seconds for full tour analysis
/// - Single-pass algorithm for optimal memory usage
/// - Progressive gap tracking for accurate rarest songs
///
/// Server replacement:
/// - Pre-computed statistics served via Vercel API
/// - Response time: ~140ms
/// - Identical results with much better performance

    /// Algorithm Overview:
    /// 1. Single pass through all tour shows (O(n) complexity)
    /// 2. Simultaneously collects data for all three statistics types
    /// 3. Uses progressive tracking for gap calculations (keeps highest gaps)
    /// 4. Applies mathematical sorting and slicing for final results
    ///
    /// Gap Calculation Logic:
    /// - Gap = shows since song was last played (anywhere, not necessarily pre-tour)
    /// - Multiple occurrences of same song: keep occurrence with highest gap
    /// - Live gap data from setlist responses ensures accuracy
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - tourShows: All enhanced setlists for the tour
    ///   - tourName: Name of the tour
    /// - Returns: Complete tour statistics calculated in single pass
